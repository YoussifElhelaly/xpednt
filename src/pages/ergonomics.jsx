                            <p>Dentists and medical specialists generally purchase magnifying loupes for two reasons: to enhance visual acuity and treatment quality and to improve working posture and comfort.  

            There are three essential, ergonomic factors to consider when looking for the right loupe:</p>

                                    <p>It´s the distance from the eyes to the work area. The right working distance is very important to avoid crouched, uncomfortable positions that will lead to chronic lower back and neck pain. A discrepancy of just a couple of cm can have a significant impact on comfort and health. When purchasing ExamVision loupes the working distance will always be individually measured and fitted to your height and work tools to achieve perfect results.</p>

                                    <p>It´s the angle that your eyes are inclined downward toward the work area. This angle should be steep enough to help you attain a comfortable working position with minimal forward head posture (20° or less). The farther the head is positioned forward to see through the loupes, the greater the strain on the neck. The correct angle is individual, as it depends on the face, frame, nose bridge height and other variables. Your ExamVision dealer always measures the declination angle individually. </p>

                                    <p>The Prisma Lens System allows you to sit up straighter and achieve a better working posture by making the focus of your vision appear higher than it really is. Prisma Lens system is optional. We can build it into your magnifying loupes at your request. It works by making light bend so that you can work in an upright position, which can be beneficial for very tall people or those who suffer from serious neck or back problems. </p>

                                    <p>Good ergonomics is very individual. If your goal is to minimise neck and back strain as much as possible, then consider the Kepler Reflekt. It will help you sit up much straighter, with full customisation offering a crisp clear image and a DoF that allows plenty of movement, which reduces muscle strain. The prism moves the image, so you will feel you are looking straight ahead, but you will be able to see your hands working close to your body, in a comfortable, relaxed, natural position.</p>
