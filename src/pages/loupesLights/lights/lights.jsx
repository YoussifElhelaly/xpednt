                    <p><strong><span>Light is not just light</span></strong><span> <br/></span><span>When looking for LED loupes light to use in dentistry or medical applications you should consider more than just aiming for maximum light intensity. Having the right light at the right spot is vital both in terms of good vision and protecting your eyes from glare and harmful light.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Loupes and light are interdependent and choosing the right&nbsp;</span><span>head</span><span>light solution is almost&nbsp;</span><span>as vital as choosing the optimum&nbsp;</span><span>loupe solution.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span>When choosing&nbsp;</span><span>Xpedent</span><span> as your surgical </span><span>loupes/dental loupes and loupes light </span><span>supplier</span><span>, your local dealer will arrange a thorough introduction on how to get the best results. Your loupes will be customised to </span><span>match</span><span>&nbsp;your working distance</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;height</span><span>&nbsp;and ergonomic needs</span><span>, and you will be guided in how to</span><span>&nbsp;attach and</span><span> focus your LED light for loupes</span><span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</span><span>achieve</span><span>&nbsp;the maximum benefit</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>So, contact your local&nbsp;</span><span>Xpedent</span><span>&nbsp;dealer for advice and guidance when choosing both loupe and light to fit your&nbsp;</span><span>optical&nbsp;</span><span>needs perfectly.</span>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span>In all&nbsp;</span><span>Xpedent</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>loupes </span><span>lights, we use "neutral white" (≤5.000 to ≤6,500 Kelvin) LEDs for the most natural lighting possible. When considering LEDs with higher Kelvin (more blue light) than the&nbsp;</span><span>Xpedent</span><span> Focus </span><span>and Essential&nbsp;</span><span>range, remember that this means consequently higher lux (or foot candles), but it also means more unnatural light, eye strain – and risk of retinal damage.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span>Our&nbsp;</span><span>precision-engineered</span><span> "Connect" system fixes the LED</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>head</span><span>light</span><span>&nbsp;to your loupes, sliding smoothly on and off, and maintains the light in a stable manner. A locking mechanism allows you to keep the light permanently attached</span><span>&nbsp;to your loupe</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;if required.</span>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong><span>Light intensity (Lux or Lumen)</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br/></span><span>Lux (lx)&nbsp;</span><span>is used for measuring the light intensity or brightness of a light source. There is a general perception that the higher the lux, the better the light.&nbsp; But this is not the case. The maximum lux-level of most LEDs (in the centre of a light, often called hot-spot) is around 30 or 40,000 lux, often measured 20-25 cm from the LED diode. But the real challenge is to get the right quantity of light at the right place in a real working situation. Because, too much light can create glare and damage your eyesight if being exposed to it over longer working hours. Obviously, too little light is just as bad.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong><span>Lumen (</span></strong><strong><span>lm</span></strong><strong><span>)&nbsp;</span></strong><span>also indicates the total amount of light emitted from a light source, where Lux is used to measure the amount of light output in a specific area. In other words – 1 Lux is the same as 1 Lumen per square meter.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br/></span><span>In general, a</span><span>&nbsp;loupe</span><span>&nbsp;light intensity around 10-20,000 lux at an average working distance of 35 cm – evenly distributed across the beam – is perfect for most dental procedures. Glare (from reflective surfaces) is reduced, protecting your eyes, and the LED</span><span>&nbsp;headlight fitted to the loupe</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>will</span><span>, together with the normal clinic/background light,&nbsp;</span><span>be&nbsp;</span><span>fully adequate to achieve a good and clear vision. Medical procedures in body cavities will often require higher lux, plus a surgeon is often standing, so the working distance is longer.&nbsp;</span><span>When purchasing an&nbsp;</span><span>Xpedent</span><span> loupe and loupe light solution our experts will </span><span>help you find the perfect fit&nbsp;</span><span>taking into consideration all&nbsp;</span><span>your professional needs.</span>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong>Colour temperature (Kelvin)</strong><span>&nbsp;<br/></span><span>The colo</span><span>u</span><span>r temperature is measured in Kelvin.&nbsp;</span><span>Colours over 5,000 K are known as ‘cool’ colours, whilst colours of a lower value on the same scale are called ‘warm’ colours.</span>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><span>Visually, a higher value gives the appearance of ‘blueish-white’ – similar to a cold, stark, clinical setting. This has been proven to increase productivity and visual acuity, keeping you alert and focused. These colours provide the dentist or surgeon with the truest tissue colour rendition.</span>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><span></span><span>If you want concentrated&nbsp;</span><span>LED&nbsp;</span><span>loupe&nbsp;</span><span>lighting that is perfect to work with</span><span>&nbsp;in surgical and medical procedures and examinations</span><span>, you should choose a colo</span><span>u</span><span>r temperature of "neutral white" (around ≤5.000 to ≤6,500 Kelvin) for the most natural lighting possible. When considering LEDs with higher Kelvin (more blue light), please remember that this means consequently higher lux</span><span> in your medical headlight</span><span>, but it also means more unnatural light, eye strain – and increased risk of retinal damage from harmful UV wavelengths.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For this reason all</span><span> Xpedent surgical headlight and dental headlight, are kept within the </span><span>≤5.000 to ≤6,500 Kelvin</span><span>&nbsp;range.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong>Colour rendering (CRI/Ra)</strong><span><strong> <br/></strong></span><span>The colo</span><span>u</span><span>r rendering value of a light source is measured in CRI (or Ra). Generally, the better you want the colo</span><span>u</span><span>rs to be reproduced, the higher a colo</span><span>u</span><span>r rendering value you might choose. LED headlight</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;used in dental and&nbsp;</span><span>surgical</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>loupe&nbsp;</span><span>applications are aimed for achieving better vision and secondarily for colour matching.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
