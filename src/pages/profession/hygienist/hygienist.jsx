                    <p>We do however have some general loupes recommendations for dental hygiene professionals. For dental hygiene examinations, preventive care, and other oral procedures a lower loupe magnification from 2.3x to 3.3x will often be sufficient. Lower loupe magnifications have the benefit of a larger range of movement and depth of field than higher magnifications, making them ideal for both entry-level users and all-day wear.
